- A standup is like a huddle.
- We keep each other updated with one another's progress.
- When giving updates, ask yourself beforehand: What did I work on yesterday? What am I working on today? What issues are blocking me?
- Keep stand-ups clear and concise (short and to the point).
- Find ways to improve future meetings.
- Have a "work board" present on meetings to visualize progress/issues.
